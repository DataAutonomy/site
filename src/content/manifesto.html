        <h1>What Is Data Autonomy?</h1>
        <p>
            Data is one of the most valuable commodities of our time.
            Empires like Facebook and Google are built on collecting
            and selling data.
        </p>
        <p>
            But data does not appear out of thin air. We are the people
            who create this valuable resource and we should take back
            control over it.

        <h2>The Data Autonomy Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
            We claim back what is ours! We claim sovereignty over our data.
            We demand every entity that collects data about us to grant us
            the three powers that are necessary to achieve Data Autonomy:

    <section>
        <h3>ðŸ’¡&nbsp;The Power of Knowledge</h3>
        <p>We have the right to know what data exists about us.</p>
        <p>
            Every entity that collects data about us has to inform us of
            that fact. They also have to inform us what data is collected
            and about the purpose of this endeavor.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>ðŸ”‘&nbsp;The Power of Access</h3>
        <p>We have the right to access our data.</p>
        <p>
            If data is stored about us or by us we have the irrevocable right
            to access it. Every service that accepts our data or collects data
            about us has to make this data accessible to us at all times until
            we decide to delete it.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>ðŸ”’&nbsp;The Power of Control</h3>
        <p>We have the right to decide who gets access to our data.</p>
        <p>
            Our data may be shared if and only if we give explicit consent to
            share a well-defined subset of our data with a specific other entity.
        </p>
        <p>
            This concerns data that we collect, like photo albums or emails, but
            also data that is collected about us, like energy use or credit card
            transactions.
